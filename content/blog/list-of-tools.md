# Texts
- [LibreTexts](https://bio.libretexts.org/) - An open source textbook projects providing freely accessible, reliable introductions to a variety of scientific topics.
- [OpenStax - Biology](https://cnx.org/contents/GFy_h8cu@11.2:rZudN6XP@2/Introduction) - Very comprehensive biology textbook
- [PDB-101](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/) - The educational portal of the protein database. Nice, often interactive visualisations of proteins. Concise introductory articles on specific proteins and a ton of fun educational material.

# Visualisation / Communication
- [Mermaid.js](https://mermaidjs.github.io/#/) - A javascript library for easily drawing Flowcharts, Gantt Charts, and Sequence Charts in Markdown. The documentation is fairly limited, and the styling options could be better. However, in general, the tool works well.
- [mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/) - A javascript library that allows you to render formulae using Latex syntax from a markdown file.
- [mhchem](https://mhchem.github.io/MathJax-mhchem/) - A Latex package that's also supported by
- [Escher](https://escher.github.io/#/) - Tool for visualising biological pahtways in the browser.
- [A Friendly Guide to Color](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colorguide/?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Data_Elixir_248) - A nice overview of resources for getting colors right in datavisualisation.

## Courses
- [Data Carpentry for Biologists](http://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/) - From the website: "This website hosts introductory material for teaching biologists how to interact with data including: data structure, database management systems, and programming for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. It is designed to be used as a flipped university course and also to be useful for self-guided students. Instructors are welcome to modify and use the material for your own courses. We encourage collaborative development and contributions by instructors, with the hopes that this will lead to better training and resources for everyone."
- [NIAID/NIH Python for Biologists](https://github.com/burkesquires/python_biologist) Includes: Introduction to the Command Line (and UNIX), Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, Introduction to Programming (with Python), The Python Programming Language (for experienced programmers), Data Analysis with Python and Pandas, Data Visualization with Python, Intermediate Python Programming and Best Practices, Bioinformatics Programming with Python, Building Workflows with Python, Biomedical Data Storage and Retrieval (using SQL & NoSQL), Becoming a Reproducible Scientist
