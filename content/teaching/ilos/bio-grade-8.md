# Genetics

## Evolution

**Basic Definitions** You should be able to provide a definition of the
following terms. They are your working vocabulary.

- [**Allele**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsaYSGWuRmo)
- **Recessive vs. Dominant**
- **Mutation**
- **Selection**
- **Evolution**

### Mendelian Genetics

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- **Mendelian genetics**


- Darwinian Selection


## Nucleic acids

**Basic Definitions** You should be able to provide a definition of the
following terms. They are your working vocabulary.

- **Histone**
- **Nucleosome**
- **Chromatin** -
- **Chromatid** -
- **Chromosome** -
- **Codon**

#### Visual Skills
- Sketch a diagram illustrating the composition of DNA/RNA without too much chemical detail.
- Draw a diagram that explains the composition and arrangement of chromatin. Explain the structure in a short diagram. Include: What is a histone and how many subunits does it have? How many nucleotides does it take for the DNA to fully wrap around a histone once?

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- Compare and contrast **structure of ribonucleic acids and deoxyribobnucleic acids** in terms of their _structure, function, cellular compartment, stability_.
    - What are the four nucleobases found in DNA? How is RNA different?
    - How can you describe the 3D stucture of DNA? What can you say about the 3D structure of RNA in general? Is DNA found in prokaryotes any different from eukaryotic DNA?
    - How do the chemical properties of DNA and RNA relate to their respective functions?
- **The many faces of RNA** What are the different functional classes of RNA? (_mRNA, tRNA, lncRNA, sRNA, rRNA_)
    - What do their names mean?
    - What is their function?
    - Where in the cell do you find them?
    - What is a ribozyme?
    - What is the [RNA World Hypothesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1xnYFCZ9Yg)

#### Further Reading & Resources
- [LibreTexts:Genetics](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Genetics/Book%3A_Online_Open_Genetics_(Nickle_and_Barrette-Ng)/01%3A_Overview%2C_DNA%2C_and_Genes) - A good and concise introduction to genetics focusing on some classic experiments that brought the field forward.

  - Reading the genome. (Sanger sequencing, Bioinformatics, Phylogenetics )
  - What do we actually know about the human genome (HGP -> Stefan Beck)
  - Cost/Complexity now vs then
- Does the complexity of the genome correspond to the complexity of the organism? (Give examples)
- Which factors are involved in the production of an RNA molecule from DNA?
- What is a transcription factor?
- Where does transcription take place?

### Regulation
#### Key Learning Outcomes
