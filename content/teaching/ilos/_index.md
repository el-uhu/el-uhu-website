These pages summarise key topics and intended learning outcomes for the corresponding years and subjects.
For the "Oberstufe", these roughly correspond to "Themenbereiche" for the Matura.
Each year is broken down into chapters and smaller subsections, each accompanied by a list of intended learning outcomes (i.e. what you should be able to do). This is by no means a comprehensive summary and should not be regarded as your sole resource for learning.
However, important figures and definitions are included for the sake of clarity.
