# Ecosystems

> **Reading:**  Kent *Advanced Biology* p. 506-507

**Basic Definitions** You should be able to provide a definition of the
following terms. They are your working vocabulary.

- [x] **Biosphere**
- [x] **Community**
- [x] **Population**
- [x] **Habitat**
- [x] **Biome**
- [x] **autotroph**
- [x] **heterotroph**

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- [x] Explain why it is useful to think about ecosystems through the lens of energy flow.
- [x] Compare and contrast biotic and abiotic factors and give examples for the latter.
- [ ] List the major terrestrial biomes (_tropical forest, svannah, desert, chaparral, temperate grassland, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra_) and characterise the biome with respect to the major abiotic and biotic factors.
- [x] What are the major categories used to describe feeding relationships within an ecosystem(_producers, herbivores, secondary consumers, tertiary consumers, decomposers_)? Which are autotroph, which are heterotroph. What do they eat?
- [ ] Provide an argument for why it is wrong to think of ecosystems as closed systems. (You may want to define what we mean by closed system.)

## Energy Flow

> **Reading:**  Kent *Advanced Biology* p. 508-511

**Prerequisites**
- [ ] First law of thermodynamics

**Basic Definitions** You should be able to provide a definition of the
following terms. They are your working vocabulary.

- [x] **Food chain**
- [x] **Food web**
- [x] **Trophic level**
- [x] **Habitat**
- [ ] **Net primary production**
- [ ] **Gross primary production**
- [ ] **Trophic efficiency**

**Important numbers**
- [ ] Solar energy per square meter: up to 5 $kJ m^{-1} s^{-1}$
- [ ] Trophic efficiency: 1%-40%, typically: 10%

| Biome                | Net primary production ($kJ m^{-1} s^{-1}$)  |
| :------------------- | --------------------------------------------:|
| Tropical rainforest  | 40000                                        |
| Temperate forest     | 26000                                        |
| Desert               | 260                                          |


#### Visual Skills
- [ ] Describe three different methods that illustrate energy flow in ecosystems. Compare and contrast them with respect to their advantages and drawbacks.
- [x] Draw a food web onto a sheet of paper and label the different trophic levels. Color-code the different organisms depending on whether they are: autotrophs, herbivores, carnivores, omnivor.
- [x] Think about relative population sizes and biomass at each trophic level, and draw a pyramid diagrams (fig.4&5) that reflect your thinking.
- [ ] Draw an idealised energy flow diagram. Include: _primary production, primary consumers, secondary consumers, detritus, decomposers, energy loss, total energy input_ Make sure to include the appropriate unit for energy flow.

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- [x] Compare and contrast food webs and food chains. What are their differences and commonalities?
- [x] Compare and contrast pyramids of numbers, biomass and energy. In which ways are they similar/different? Explain using and example.
- [x] What do pyramids of energy tell us about ecosystems? Why do they get narrower with increasing trophic level?
- [ ] What is bioaccumulation? Describe the process using an example and explain how food webs help us in understanding how bioaccumulation works.
- [ ] Not all substances become more concentrated in organisms with increasing trophic level. Which molecular properties facilitate bioaccumulation?
- [ ] What restricts the number of links in a food chain/ trophic levels in a food web? What are typical numbers for trophic levels?
- [ ] Which trophic level do decomposers belong to?
- [ ] How much solar energy is received per square meter and minute? (i.e. what is the flow of solar energy received by one square meter per minute?) How about per year? How much of this energy is converted into chemical energy by way of photosynthesis? Which factors may affect this energy input?
- [ ] Which measures are used to compare the productivty of ecosystems? Can you draw a comparison to metrics used to compare the productivity of economies/states?
- [ ] What is the relationship between gross primary production, net primary production and respiration?
- [ ] How do rainforests, temperate forests and deserts compare with respect to their net primary production?
- [ ] Compare primary production and secondary production. Which factors account for one being smaller than the other?

#### Thinking critically
- [ ] Draw on your knowledge about energy flow in ecosystems to explain...
  - [ ] ... why the future of humanity may be vegetarian/vegan.
  - [ ] ... why it is more sustainable and healthy to eat sardines than tuna.
  - [ ] ... why we rarely see large carnivorous animals, and why whales are an exception.
  - [ ] ... why the trophic efficiency of zooplankton feeding on phytoplankton is larger than that of a goat feeding on shrubs.
