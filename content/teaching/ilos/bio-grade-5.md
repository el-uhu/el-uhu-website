# What is Life?

## Levels of Organisation


- Explain the concepts of system (part <=> whole) & emergence.
- Classify (parts of) living things according to their level of biological organisation (cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organism, population, community, ecosystem, biosphere)

# Biomolecules
> **Prerequisites - Water**
> -  Review the physical and chemical properties of water. How is water different from similar small molecules? (-> _Anomalies of water_) How might these properties affect/afford life?

**Basic Definitions** You should be able to provide a definition of the following terms. They are your working vocabulary.

- Monomer vs. polymer
- Organic molecule

## DNA

{{<rel-figure src="/img/teaching/ilos/bio-year-5/dna.jpg">}}

**Basic Definitions** You should be able to provide a definition of the following terms. They are your working vocabulary.

- Nucleobase
- Nucleoside
- Nucleotide
- Triplet
- Double helix
- Ribose vs. Deoxyribose

**Nucleid acid structure** Sketch the structure of a single nucleotide without chemical detail and explain how nucleotides get assembles into strands of nucleotides.

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- **Compare and contrast composition (bulding blocks), function and shape of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates** using a table.
- **RNA vs DNA** Wow are RNA and DNA different from a structural and a functional viewpoint?
- **The Genetic Code** What is a gene? What do we need genes for? How many genes does a human have? How are DNA, RNA and proteins related? How can 20 amino acids be encoded using just four letters?
- **Watson Crick Model** Describe the 3D structure of DNA. Include the following terms in your description: _nucleotide, sugar-phosphate-backbone, strand, base pairing, helix_
- In spite of being close to 2m long in a human cell, DNA is too small to observe directly. How do we know what we know about the structure of nucleic acids?

## Proteins and Amino Acids

**Basic Definitions** You should be able to provide a definition of the following terms. They are your working vocabulary.

- Amino acid
- Peptide bond
- Active site
- Hydrophobic vs Hydrophilic

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- List the major functions proteins perform in living things and give examples.
- Distinguish between primary, secondary, tertiary and quarternary structure.
- What is a structural motif and how is it useful in discussing proteins?
- List the chemical forces that give rise to secondary structure in proteins and can describe how secondary structure arises.
- Compare and contrast the major secondary structure motifs, including $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets.

## Sugars and Polysaccharides
## Lipids and Membranes

**Basic Definitions** You should be able to provide a definition of the following terms. They are your working vocabulary.

- Hydrocarbon chain
- Amphiphilic

**Structure of lipids and membranes**  ___A)___ Draw a diagram of the membrane, and label it using the terms – _phosphate head, fatty acid tails, hydrophobic, hydrophilic, intrinsic proteins, extrinsic proteins, channel proteins, glycoproteins, glycolipid_.
___B)___ Draw a schematic of a phospholipid and explain why phospholipids will form a bilayer.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- **Fluid Mosaic Model** Explain the name”fluid mosaic model”. Give examples of different types of membrane proteins.
- List factors that can affect the permeability of a membrane.

## Diffusion and Osmosis

#### Key Learning Outcomes
- Explain diffusion in terms of spontaneous movement, concentration gradients and thermal energy.
- Define the term **permeability** and explain what it has to do with diffusion and osmosis.
- Compare and contrast different ways (active and passive) in which a molecule can pass across a membrane. Include: _diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active transport_.
- Compare and contrast diffusion and osmosis.
- How are diffusion and osmosis important for biological systems? Give examples.
- Define diffusion – give example of a molecule which will move...
    - through the phospholipid bilayer by diffusion
    - through channel proteins by diffusion
    - through proteins by “facilitated” diffusion
    - require active transport to move through the membrane.
- Define osmosis and describe how osmosis works using the terms strong solution / weak solution or concentrated solution / less concentrated
