- How much solar energy is received per square meter and minute? (i.e. what is the flow of solar energy received by one square meter per minute?) How about per year? How much of this energy is converted into chemical energy by way of photosynthesis? Which factors may affect this energy input?
- Draw an idealised energy flow diagram. Include: _primary production, primary consumers, secondary consumers, detritus, decomposers, energy loss, total energy input_ Make sure to include the appropriate unit for energy flow.
- Which measures are used to compare the productivty of ecosystems? Can you draw a comparison to metrics used to compare the productivity of economies/states?
- What is the relationship between gross primary production, net primary production and respiration?
- How do rainforests, temperate forests and deserts compare with respect to their net primary production?
- Compare primary production and secondary production. Which factors account for one being smaller than the other?
